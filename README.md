# kanata-tray

A simple wrapper for [kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata) to control it from tray icon.
Works on Windows, Linux and macOS.

### Note: there's now Windows-only native tray app support in kanata (https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/pull/990)

See [#24](https://github.com/rszyma/kanata-tray/issues/24) for comparison

## Features

- Tray icon for kanata, with start/stop/pause buttons.
- Easy switching between multiple kanata configurations from tray icon.
- Allow to set custom tray icons for active kanata layers.
- Blink icon on successful kanata config reload.
- Hooks (custom scripts/programs that will run before/after kanata start/stop)
- Support for running multiple kanata instances with different configurations at the same time.
- Works out-of-the box with no configuration, but can be configured with toml file.

## Configuration

Default config file will be autogenerated for you on the first run.
You can access it from from: `Click Tray Icon > Configure`.

Config file name is `kanata-tray.toml`.

The config folder location:
- Linux `~/.config/kanata-tray`.
- Windows `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\kanata-tray`
- macOS `$HOME/Library/Application\ Support/kanata-tray`

Alternatively, you can place your config file in the same folder as kanata-tray executable,
and it will be have higher priority than the global config in user folder.

Custom config directory location can be set with `KANATA_TRAY_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable.

### Examples

An example of customized configuration file:

```toml
'$schema' = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rszyma/kanata-tray/main/doc/config_schema.json'

[general]
allow_concurrent_presets = false

[defaults]
kanata_executable = '~/bin/kanata' # if empty or omitted, system $PATH will be searched.
kanata_config = '' # if empty or not omitted, kanata default config locations will be used.
tcp_port = 5829 # if not specified, defaults to 5829

[defaults.hooks]
# Hooks allow running custom commands on specific events (e.g. starting preset).
# Documentation: https://github.com/rszyma/kanata-tray/blob/main/doc/hooks.md

[defaults.layer_icons]
mouse = 'mouse.png'
qwerty = 'qwerty.ico'
'*' = 'other_layers.ico'

[presets.'main cfg']
kanata_config = '~/.config/kanata/test.kbd'
autorun = true
# kanata_executable = ''
# layer_icons = {  }
# tcp_port = 1234

[presets.'test cfg']
kanata_config = '~/.config/kanata/test.kbd'

```
### Explanation

`presets` - a config item, that adds an entry to tray menu. Each preset can have different settings for running kanata with:
`kanata_config`, `kanata_executable`, `autorun`, `layer_icons`, `tcp_port`.

`preset.autorun` - when set to true, preset will run at kanata-tray startup.

`preset.layer_icons` - maps kanata layer names to custom icons. Custom icons should be placed in `icons` folder in config directory, next to `kanata-tray.toml`. Accepted icon types on Linux are `.ico`, `.png`, `.jpg`; on Windows only `.ico` is supported. You can assign an icon to special identifier `'*'` to change icon for other layers not specified in `[layer_icons]`.

`defaults` - a config item, that allows to overwrite default values for all presets.
It accepts same configuration options that `presets` do.

`general.allow_concurrent_presets` - when enabled, allows running multiple presets at the same time.
When disabled, switching presets will stop currently running preset (if any).
Disabled by default.

Other notes:
- You can use `~` in `kanata_config` and `kanata_executable` to substitute to your "home" directory.
- On Windows: make sure to surround paths with single-quotes `'` instead of double-quotes, otherwise paths will not work (because `\` would be treated as escape character).

### Hooks

Hooks allow running custom commands on specific events (e.g. starting preset).
[Hooks documentation](./doc/hooks.md).

### Config completion in editors

In VSCode to get editor support for your kanata-tray config, install [Even Better TOML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml#completion-and-validation-with-json-schema) extension and the following line at the top of your `kanata-tray.toml` file.
```toml
"$schema" = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rszyma/kanata-tray/main/doc/config_schema.json"
```

## Supported Kanata Versions

Minimal supported version of kanata is `v1.6.0`.

More specifically, builds after commit [010338b](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/commit/010338b14d0020098b9263a615ef2152c249d666) (because it fixed an issue with TCP server)

## Troubleshooting

Log file - By default kanata-tray will try to write a log file named `kanata_tray_lastrun.log` in the same directory as itself. If it causes problems e.g. because of the location is read-only, the log directory can be changed by setting new path in `KANATA_TRAY_LOG_DIR` environment variable.

Debug logs - more verbose kanata-tray output, debug logging can be enabled with `--log-level=1` flag. You can use it to see loaded config struct or raw tcp messages from kanata.
